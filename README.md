Prior to this, had minimal exposure to GraphQL. Did not know what apollo was at all! Apollo/Playground seems to be a replacement for Postman / Insomnia, from the looks of it? 

In particular with using plasma, the process is similar to Rails or Node where you do "yarn dev" or "rails s." 

First impressions with Playground is that it seems to be more beginner-friendly. There is a "schema" green button on the right side of the IDE, which allows you to quickly reference schema.
